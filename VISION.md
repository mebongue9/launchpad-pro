# Project Vision

**Created:** 2025-01-02
**Last Vision Review:** 2025-01-02

## The One-Sentence Purpose
We are building **Launchpad Pro** so that **coaches can generate complete, professionally designed product funnels and lead magnets in minutes instead of weeks — ready to sell immediately**.

---

## What We're Building

### The Problem
Coaches struggle to create and launch digital products because:
1. They don't know what products to create or how to structure offers
2. Writing sales copy, lead magnets, and product content takes forever
3. Designing professional-looking materials requires skills they don't have
4. The gap between "idea" and "ready to sell" is too wide

### The Solution
An AI-powered app that:
1. Generates complete funnel architectures (front-end → bumps → upsells)
2. Creates the actual content for each product
3. Designs professional PDFs and presentations
4. Delivers ready-to-use promotion materials (video scripts, captions)

### Success Looks Like
A coach can:
1. Enter their niche and audience
2. Get a complete funnel strategy
3. Generate a lead magnet with designed PDF
4. Get video scripts and social captions
5. Start promoting within the same day

**Time from idea to launch: Hours, not weeks.**

## Core Features (Must Have)

1. **Profile & Audience Management**
   - Why essential: Personalization requires knowing the coach and their audience
   - Success criteria: Can save and reuse profiles/audiences across sessions

2. **Funnel Strategy Generator**
   - Why essential: Core value — tells coaches exactly what to create
   - Success criteria: Generates coherent 5-product funnel with pricing

3. **Lead Magnet Creator**
   - Why essential: Lead magnets are the entry point to every funnel
   - Success criteria: Generates content + designed PDF + promotion kit

4. **Visual Builder (11 Style Templates)**
   - Why essential: Professional design is a major blocker for coaches
   - Success criteria: Beautiful PDFs that coaches are proud to share

5. **Promotion Kit**
   - Why essential: Content without promotion = no sales
   - Success criteria: Ready-to-record video script + copy-paste captions

---

## Nice to Have (Future)
- Full product content generation (not just lead magnets)
- Presentation mode for live walkthroughs
- History of all generations
- Export to Canva/Google Slides
- Team collaboration

Why not now: MVP needs to prove core value first

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

❌ **Payment processing** — Not building checkout or Stripe integration
❌ **Email marketing** — Not sending emails or managing lists
❌ **Landing page builder** — Not building sales pages
❌ **Course hosting** — Not delivering content to end customers
❌ **Analytics** — Not tracking sales or conversions
❌ **Multi-user teams** — Single user accounts only for MVP

Why excluded: These expand scope dramatically. Coaches already have tools for these. We focus on the creation gap.

## Target User

- **Primary user:** Online coaches (business, life, health, relationship)
- **Their goal:** Create and sell digital products without tech overwhelm
- **Their context:** Solo entrepreneurs, not technical, time-poor, need results fast

**Not for:** Agencies, enterprise, developers, or coaches who already have product creation systems

---

## Boundaries

### Technical Boundaries
- Single-page app (no complex routing)
- Claude API for all generation (no fine-tuned models)
- Supabase for everything backend
- PDF generation from HTML (no complex document libraries)

### Time Boundaries
- MVP in 2-3 weeks
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Days 1-3
- Phase 2 (AI Features): Days 4-8
- Phase 3 (Visual Builder): Days 9-14
- Phase 4 (Polish): Days 15-18

## Vision Check Questions

When evaluating any work, ask:
1. Does this directly serve the one-sentence purpose?
2. Does this help achieve a core feature?
3. Is this explicitly out of scope?
4. Would removing this prevent the project from fulfilling its purpose?
5. Is this solving the coach's problem or our problem?
