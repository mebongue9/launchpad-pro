# CODE VERSION VIOLATIONS REPORT

**Generated:** [Date/Time will be added by agent]
**Agent:** code-execution-verifier
**Project:** Launchpad Pro

---

## Report Status

**This is a TEMPLATE file.** The actual violations report will be generated by the `code-execution-verifier` agent.

To generate a real report, run:
```bash
# Use Task tool to launch agent
Task(subagent_type='code-execution-verifier', prompt='Verify no deprecated code is being executed')
```

---

## Template Format

The agent will generate a report in this format:

### CRITICAL Issues (Block Deployment)

These violations MUST be fixed before any deployment:

- [ ] `[file path]:[line]` - [Description of what's wrong]
      **Expected:** [What should be used instead]
      **Current:** [What's currently being used]
      **Impact:** [Why this matters - API calls, credits, performance]
      **Fix:** [Specific actionable fix with code example]

### HIGH Priority Issues

These should be fixed ASAP (before next release):

- [ ] `[file path]:[line]` - [Description]
      **Expected:** [Correct version]
      **Current:** [Deprecated version]
      **Impact:** [Impact statement]
      **Fix:** [How to fix with code example]

### MEDIUM Priority Issues

Code quality improvements (do not block deployment):

- [ ] `[file path]:[line]` - [Description]
      **Expected:** [Correct version]
      **Current:** [Outdated pattern]
      **Fix:** [How to improve]

---

## Summary

**Total violations:** [N]
- 🔴 CRITICAL: [N] (blocks deployment)
- 🟠 HIGH: [N] (fix before next release)
- 🟡 MEDIUM: [N] (improve code quality)

---

## Deployment Decision

The agent will provide one of these verdicts:

- **✅ APPROVED** - No violations found, safe to deploy
- **⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** - No CRITICAL issues, but fix HIGH priority items ASAP
- **❌ BLOCKED** - CRITICAL issues found, MUST fix before deployment

---

## Example Report

Here's what a real report might look like:

### CRITICAL Issues (Block Deployment)

- [ ] `src/pages/LeadMagnetBuilder.jsx:196` - Calls `contentJob.generateContent()` which triggers OLD endpoint
      **Expected:** `generateContent()` from `useLeadMagnets` hook → calls `generate-lead-magnet-content-batched`
      **Current:** `contentJob.generateContent()` → calls `generate-lead-magnet-content` (deprecated)
      **Impact:** Makes 8 API calls instead of 2 batched calls, wasting ~75% of API credits
      **Fix:**
      ```javascript
      // Remove this import (line 14):
      import { useLeadMagnetContentJob } from '../hooks/useGenerationJob'

      // Add generateContent to useLeadMagnets destructuring (line 90):
      const { leadMagnets, saveLeadMagnet, getExcludedTopics, generateContent } = useLeadMagnets()

      // Replace contentJob.generateContent() call (line 196):
      const result = await generateContent(selectedIdea, profile, audience, frontEndProduct)
      ```

### HIGH Priority Issues

- [ ] `src/pages/LeadMagnetBuilder.jsx:14` - Imports `useLeadMagnetContentJob` (deprecated hook)
      **Expected:** Import `useLeadMagnets` and use `generateContent` method
      **Current:** `import { useLeadMagnetContentJob } from '../hooks/useGenerationJob'`
      **Impact:** Encourages using old job-based system instead of batched generation
      **Fix:** Remove this import entirely, already using `useLeadMagnets` hook

### MEDIUM Priority Issues

(None in this example)

---

## Summary

**Total violations:** 2
- 🔴 CRITICAL: 1 (blocks deployment)
- 🟠 HIGH: 1 (fix before next release)
- 🟡 MEDIUM: 0

---

## Deployment Decision

**❌ BLOCKED** - Must fix CRITICAL issues before deploying

**Reasoning:**
- 1 CRITICAL violation found that wastes API credits
- Old endpoint makes 8 calls instead of 2 batched calls
- This exact issue has caused problems before
- MUST fix before any deployment or testing

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix the CRITICAL violation at line 196
2. Remove deprecated import at line 14
3. Re-run code-execution-verifier agent
4. Verify report shows ✅ APPROVED
5. Then proceed with testing and deployment

---

## How to Use This Report

### If Report Shows ❌ BLOCKED:
1. **STOP** - Do not deploy, do not test
2. **Fix** all CRITICAL violations immediately
3. **Verify** fixes with code snippets and line numbers
4. **Re-run** agent to confirm violations resolved
5. **Continue** only after ✅ APPROVED verdict

### If Report Shows ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS:
1. **Okay to deploy** - No CRITICAL blockers
2. **Plan fixes** for HIGH priority items
3. **Schedule** fixes before next release
4. **Monitor** for any issues in production
5. **Update** deprecation registry if needed

### If Report Shows ✅ APPROVED:
1. **Proceed** with testing pipeline
2. **Deploy** with confidence
3. **Monitor** as usual
4. **Maintain** registry for future deprecations
