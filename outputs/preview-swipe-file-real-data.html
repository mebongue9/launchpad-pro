Body: &quot;The real issue isn&#039;t that you&#039;re [common assumption]. It&#039;s that you don&#039;t have [specific solution your product provides]. Most people think they need [wrong solution], but what actually works is [your method]. I figured this out after [brief credibility statement].&quot;

Pitch: &quot;If you want [desired outcome], I created [your product name] that shows you exactly how to [specific benefit]. It&#039;s [price] and the link&#039;s in my bio.&quot;

CTA: &quot;Comment [keyword] if you want the link sent directly to your DMs.&quot;

**EXAMPLE:**

Hook: &quot;Here&#039;s why you&#039;re still broke on Instagram even though you&#039;ve tried everything...&quot;

Body: &quot;The real issue isn&#039;t that you&#039;re not posting enough. It&#039;s that you don&#039;t have a system that turns views into sales. Most people think they need to go viral, but what actually works is strategic content that attracts buyers. I figured this out after making $2,500 per reel.&quot;

Pitch: &quot;If you want to make $50 daily, I created the Daily Sales Blueprint that shows you exactly how to convert small audiences. It&#039;s $27 and the link&#039;s in my bio.&quot;

&quot;I see these [topic] mistakes EVERYWHERE 😅

Mistake #1: [Expand on first mistake and why it&#039;s costing them]

Mistake #2: [Expand on second mistake]

Mistake #3: [Expand on third mistake]

Here&#039;s the thing - most people make these mistakes because [reason why]. But when you fix these three things, [positive outcome they&#039;ll get].

I actually put together my entire [topic] system that covers these mistakes (and [number] others) in [your product name]. It&#039;s [brief description of what it includes].

TEMPLATE #5: THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES MONEY REVEAL REEL

Hook: &quot;Here&#039;s how much I made from [specific action/product/strategy] this [time period]&quot;

Reveal Structure:
• Show your screen/results: &quot;This is my [dashboard/bank account/sales page] from [time period]&quot;
• State the numbers: &quot;Total: $[amount] from [specific thing]&quot;
• Break it down: &quot;That breaks down to $[daily amount] per day&quot;
• Connect to viewer: &quot;And honestly, if you have [small requirement like &#039;100 followers&#039;], you should be making at least $[smaller amount] daily&quot;

Transition to Pitch:
&quot;The reason this works so well is because of [your method/system]. I literally just [simple action] and [result]. If you want me to show you exactly how I do this, I put everything in [your product name]. Link&#039;s in my bio.&quot;

Caption Template:
&quot;I wasn&#039;t going to share this because it feels weird posting about money... but you guys keep asking 🤷‍♀️

This is what I made last [time period] from just [your method]: $[amount]

That&#039;s $[daily breakdown] per day.

And honestly? If you have [basic requirement], you should be making at least $[smaller goal] every single day. That&#039;s $[monthly amount] per month - not a massive amount, but enough to [benefit they&#039;d get].

The main reason you&#039;re not hitting this yet is probably because you&#039;re overthinking it.

Here&#039;s literally all I do:
• [Step 1 of your process]
• [Step 2 of your process]  
• [Step 3 of your process]

That&#039;s it. Rinse and repeat until I hit my income goal.

I recorded everything step-by-step in [your product name] because this system works for my students too. [Student result/testimonial if you have one].

If you want the complete system, it&#039;s [price] through the link in my bio.

TEMPLATE #6: THE DIRECT CHALLENGE REEL

Hook: &quot;If you&#039;re not making at least $[specific amount] per [time period] with [your solution], you&#039;re doing it wrong&quot;

Challenge Structure:
• Call out the problem: &quot;Here&#039;s the thing - making $[amount] with [method] is not hard&quot;
• Set the standard: &quot;If you have [basic requirement], you should be hitting this&quot;
• Identify what&#039;s wrong: &quot;The reason you&#039;re not is because [common problem]&quot;
• Issue the challenge: &quot;So here&#039;s what you&#039;re going to do this week...&quot;

Action Steps:
1. [Specific action they can take today]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action that leads to your product]

Direct Pitch:
&quot;And if you want me to walk you through this entire system step-by-step, I put everything in [your product name]. It&#039;s [price], takes [time to complete], and honestly, if you follow it, you&#039;ll make that back in [timeframe]. Link&#039;s in my bio.&quot;

Caption Template:
&quot;Okay, real talk time 💯

If you&#039;re not making at least $[amount] per [time period] right now, something needs to change.

This isn&#039;t about being mean - it&#039;s about being real. Making $[amount] with [your method] is absolutely doable. My students with [basic requirement] do it. I do it. You can too.

The reason you&#039;re stuck at $0 (or whatever you&#039;re making now) is probably because:
• [Common mistake #1]
• [Common mistake #2]
• [Common mistake #3]

So here&#039;s your assignment for this week:

Day 1-2: [Specific action]
Day 3-4: [Second action]  
Day 5-7: [Third action]

Do this and you&#039;ll start seeing results within [timeframe].

Now, if you want the complete system I use to consistently make $[your results], I put everything in [your product name]. It shows you exactly what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.

It&#039;s [price] and takes about [time to complete]. Honestly, if you follow it, you&#039;ll make that back in [realistic timeframe].

Stop overthinking this. You want [result they want]? Go get [your product name] through the link in my bio and actually follow it.

Who&#039;s ready to finally hit $[goal amount]? 👇&quot;

Why This Works:
• Creates urgency and calls out their current situation
• Gives them immediate actions they can take
• Positions your product as the complete solution
• The direct approach attracts serious buyers, not just viewers

Posting Strategy:
• Post at 10am or 1pm in your timezone for maximum engagement
• Pin this type of reel if it performs well
• Respond to comments quickly to keep engagement high

There you have it - five reel templates that turn small audiences into daily sales. Each one is designed to work with just 100 views because they attract buyers, not just viewers.

Remember: consistency beats perfection. Pick one template, use it this week, then try another. The key is getting comfortable with pitching clearly and directly.

Once you start seeing daily sales from these reels, you&#039;ll want to scale up your income. That&#039;s where having a complete system becomes crucial. If you&#039;re ready to build this into a real $3,000+ per month income stream, even if you&#039;re starting from zero, you&#039;ll need the right framework to make it predictable and repeatable. The foundations you&#039;re building with these reels are just the beginning of what&#039;s possible when you have the complete system in place.
